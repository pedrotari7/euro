					<li style="background-color: #F7DCDC">None of the above - 0 points</li>

				<h4>Groups</h4>
				<p>You will be awarded 1 point per each succesful guess on a team's final classification in the group stage.</p>
				<h4>Final Stages</h4>

Nonetheless in case of overtime or penalties if you guessed the team that is going through to the next stage, you will be awarded 1 extra point that adds to the ones that you might have acheived during the regular time.</p>

					<li>Top Scorer - 5 points (if the chosen player is tied for first, the 5 points will awarded)</li>
					<li>Player of the tournament - 5 points</li>
